I want to create a react-native, expo, ios chat application. The chat will have 2 functionalities:
1. Chat with a OpenAI model
2. View and open historical chats.

A chat is basically a conversation thread between human and the agent.
There will also be a setting's page, in which the user can set their OpenAI api key.

the request to openai api will be made using axios. Below is simple curl example:

```request
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-4.1",
    "messages": [
      {
        "role": "system",
        "content": "You are a helpful assistant."
      },
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Hello!"
      }
    ],
    "stream": true
  }'

```

and the response will be like:

```
{"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1694268190,"model":"gpt-4o-mini", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44709d6fcb", "choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"role":"assistant","content":""},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":null}]}

{"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1694268190,"model":"gpt-4o-mini", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44709d6fcb", "choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{"content":"Hello"},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":null}]}

....

{"id":"chatcmpl-123","object":"chat.completion.chunk","created":1694268190,"model":"gpt-4o-mini", "system_fingerprint": "fp_44709d6fcb", "choices":[{"index":0,"delta":{},"logprobs":null,"finish_reason":"stop"}]}

```


The responses should be streamed into the view.
